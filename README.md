# hackdavis 2021 - trash tracker
collaborative project for hackdavis 2021; an app titled "trash tracker" that logs daily carbon footprint with the intent of managing individual environmental accountability. through this, our team aimed to gain experience in android app development, agile methodology, and ui/ux design. 

beyond software development, research into this project educated us on the sheer impact of humanity on the environment, particularly in terms of carbon footprint, and left us with not only knowledge of android application development but also how to alleviate our environmental impact.
